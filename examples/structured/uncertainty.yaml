# Uncertainty specification for the mass-spring-damper closed-loop system
#
# This file defines the uncertainty model for reachability analysis:
# - Disturbance bounds on inputs
# - Parametric uncertainty on physical parameters
# - Initial condition uncertainty

disturbances:
  # Bounded disturbance force
  d:
    type: bounded
    bound: 1.0
    norm: inf

parameters:
  # Mass uncertainty (10% around nominal)
  m:
    nominal: 1.0
    bounds: [0.9, 1.1]

  # Damping uncertainty (20% around nominal)
  c:
    nominal: 0.2
    bounds: [0.16, 0.24]

  # Spring constant uncertainty (10% around nominal)
  k:
    nominal: 1.0
    bounds: [0.9, 1.1]

initial_conditions:
  # Errors start at zero (tracking reference)
  e:
    type: zero
  ev:
    type: zero
