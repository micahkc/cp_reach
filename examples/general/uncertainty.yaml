# Uncertainty specification for reachability analysis
#
# Currently only disturbance bounds are used by the LMI solver.
# Parameter uncertainty and initial conditions are parsed but not
# yet implemented in the reachability analysis.

disturbances:
  # Bounded disturbance force on the plant
  d:
    type: bounded
    bound: 1.0
    norm: inf
